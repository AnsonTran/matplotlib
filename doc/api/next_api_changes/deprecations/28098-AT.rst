``Affine2DBase``, ``BlendedAffine2D`` and ``CompositeAffine2D``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to support 3-dimensional transforms, the following deprecations have been
made. The deprecated classes can be directly replaced with the new alternatives

- ``Affine2DBase`` has been replaced with ``AffineImmutable``
- ``BlendedAffine2D`` has been replaced with ``BlendedAffine``
- ``CompositeAffine2D`` has been replaced with ``CompositeAffine``.
